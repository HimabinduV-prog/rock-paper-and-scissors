We are beginning to play rock,paper and scissors game with the computer. So the game starts out by asking you to type zero, one for paper and two for scissors.
What this game boils down to is spme way of randomly making a coice between rock, paper or scissors,
and then based on the rules of rock,paper and scissors, determining whether if you won,you lost or whether if you had a drawer.
The game is determined by 3 simple rules: 
    *Rock wins against scissors.
    *Scissors win against paper.
    *Paper wins against rock.
Now that you'll notice that in the starting of the project, there's an Ascii art for rock,paper and scissors and each art is saved to a variable.
There's a couple of things to think about namely, how are you going to decide who won or who lost?
How are you going to get the computer to choose a random shape rock,paper or scissors and how are you actually get this game to work in the same way that is demoed in this final version?
lets start with the basic logic of this game by generating a random number between 0 and 2 ,
well if computer chose scissors and user chose paper,then user going to lose,
or if computer chose rock and i chose paper,then user going to win
First thing we need to do is produce a user choice
